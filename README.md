# Coupling-Structure-Dynamics-with-Translation-Regulation
Based on SHAPE-map sequencing data and Ribo-seq sequencing data, we studied possible posttranscriptional  regulation, structural changes and translation efficiency of Arabidopsis thaliana before and after stimulation.  Through various existing tools and statistical analysis methods, we linked the information of differential  splicing, differential expression, structural changes and differential translation in the two cases, and found that  the secondary structure of RNA had a certain correlation with differential splicing, and it would affect the  transcription efficiency. These secondary structures that affect gene expression have a certain motif.
